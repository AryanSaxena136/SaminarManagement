            <h1>Seminar Course & Discussion</h1>
            <p>
                A seminar course in college is an interactive academic program designed to develop students' research,
                presentation, and discussion skills.
                Unlike traditional lecture-based classes, seminar courses focus on student-led learning.
                Small groups select specific topics related to the course theme, conduct in-depth research, and present
                their
                findings to peers and faculty.
                These presentations are followed by open discussions, encouraging critical thinking and diverse
                viewpoints.
                Students are often required to submit a report and receive feedback.
                This subject course helps enhance communication, confidence, teamwork, and knowledge sharing.
